# Connect-4-using-Pygame
The Python code utilizes Pygame to implement a Connect 4 game with a 6x7 grid. Players take turns dropping red or yellow coins, and the game visually previews coin placement based on mouse movement. The program checks for winning moves and displays a victory message before exiting.
