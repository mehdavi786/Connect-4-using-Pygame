# Connect-4-using-Pygame

This Python code implements a two-player Connect 4 game using the Pygame library. It defines functions for creating the game board, handling player moves, checking for winning conditions, and drawing the graphical user interface (GUI). The game board is represented as a 6x7 NumPy array, and players alternate turns dropping their red or yellow coins by clicking on columns. The GUI displays the current state of the board, and the program checks for winning moves in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. The game continues until a player wins, and a victory message is printed to the console before the program exits. The GUI also provides a visual preview of the coin drop location based on mouse movement. The code demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, functions, and Pygame functionalities to create an interactive Connect 4 experience.
